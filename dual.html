    <h1>DualSense – DualShock 5 – PS5 Controller</h1>
    <p>Haptic Feedback – Adds a variety of powerful sensations you’ll feel when you play, such as the slow grittiness of driving a car through mud. 
    <p>Gran Turismo 7 Players will actually be able to feel anti-lock brakes with the DualSense controller. (source)</p>
    <p>Aadaptive Triggers for the the L2 and R2 buttons of DualSense so you can truly feel the tension of your actions,</p>
    <p>like when drawing a bow to shoot an arrow.
    Strong battery life for DualSense’s rechargeable battery.</p>
    <p>Lighter Weight.
    There is no longer a “Share” button. Replaced with “Create” button feature.
    Built-in microphone array, </p>
    <p>which will enable players to easily chat with friends with or without a headset.</p>
    <p>Two-toned color design.
    Changed the position of the light bar that will give it an extra pop. On DualShock 4,</p>
    <p>it sat on the top of the controller; now it sits at each side of the touch pad, giving it a slightly larger look and feel.</p>
   <p>went through several concepts and hundreds of mockups over the last few years before we settled on this final design.</p>
   <p>DualSense has been tested by a wide range of gamers with a variety of hand sizes, in order for us to achieve the </p>
   <p>comfort level we wanted, with great ergonomics.</p>
   <p>For DualSense, Sony has dropped the all-black design that its consoles have released with since the PS2,<p> 
   <p>also opting for a two-tone design that it has never explored as a default colour scheme. <p>

<p>The new controller ditches the long-running colours on the face buttons. Instead, <p>
<p>choosing to go for white buttons featuring a muted grey colour.<p>
<p>The buttons themselves appear transparent rather than the matte black design they’ve had in the past.<p>

<p>The overall shape of the DualSense also represents a big departure from previous DualShocks too – <p>
<p>potentially explaining why it isn’t simply named the DualShock 5. <p>
<p>The design is a bit more, dare I say, Xbox-like. While it is far from looking like a straight-up copy of</p> 
<p>the Xbox controller design,<p>
<p>it definitely seems to have added a bit more of the chunky-style and a more angular shape.<p>

<p>The thumbsticks of the DualShock 4 represent my own biggest bugbear with the PS4’s controller  <p>
<p>and, thankfully, if you look closely at the DualSense, it does seem like the PS5 controller will<p>
<p> feature  a slightly  refined design. Ideally, this will be a new and more durable material.</p>
